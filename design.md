# Scaling Email Parsing Pipeline to 10M+ Emails/Day on AWS

## Key Requirements
- Process 10M+ emails daily (~116 emails/second)
- Extract nested/forwarded emails
- Normalize addresses and clean email bodies
- Assign thread IDs to related conversations
- Maintain data consistency and reliability
- Provide fault tolerance and recovery

## Architecture Overview

### Ingestion Layer
- **S3 Input Buckets**: Raw email files stored in partitioned buckets
- **SQS Queues**: Buffer incoming email processing requests
- **Lambda Triggers**: Monitor S3 uploads and add messages to SQS

### Processing Layer
- **ECS/Fargate Cluster**: Containerized parsing workers that scale horizontally
- **Step Functions**: Orchestrate multi-stage processing workflow
- **Distributed Processing**: Map-reduce approach for different processing stages

### Storage Layer
- **DynamoDB**: For thread identification and deduplication
- **RDS/Aurora**: Store processed email metadata and thread relationships
- **Elasticsearch**: Index email content for search capabilities
- **S3**: Store processed email bodies in compressed parquet format

### Monitoring & Control
- **CloudWatch**: Metrics, logs, and alarms
- **AWS X-Ray**: Tracing and performance analysis
- **EventBridge**: Schedule and trigger batch operations

## Detailed Design

### 1. Ingestion & Preprocessing
- S3 Event Notifications trigger Lambda functions when new emails arrive
- Lambda performs initial validation and metadata extraction
- Validated emails are queued into SQS for processing
- DynamoDB tracks processing state of each email

### 2. Distributed Processing

#### Approach 1: Serverless with AWS Lambda
- Lambda functions process emails in parallel (chunked by S3 key prefix)
- Each function handles a subset of emails with 15-minute execution window
- State tracking in DynamoDB enables resumability
- Pros: Auto-scaling, no maintenance; Cons: 15-min timeout, memory limits

#### Approach 2: Container-based with ECS/Fargate
- Docker containers with email processing code
- Auto-scaling based on SQS queue depth
- Each container pulls batches of emails from SQS
- Pros: No time limits, configurable memory; Cons: More complex management

### 3. Email Parsing Pipeline Stages
1. **Initial Parse**: Extract headers and basic structure
2. **Body Processing**: Clean and extract nested messages
3. **Thread Analysis**: Determine conversation threads
4. **Storage**: Save processed data to appropriate data stores

### 4. Thread Identification Strategy
- Use LSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing) to cluster similar emails
- Store thread signatures in DynamoDB with TTL for active threads
- Batch process older threads with EMR/Spark for historical analysis

### 5. Data Storage Strategy
- **Hot Data** (recent emails): Aurora PostgreSQL with partitioning
- **Warm Data** (1-3 months): RDS with selective indices
- **Cold Data** (3+ months): S3 with Athena/Glue for ad-hoc queries
- Apply time-based partitioning for efficient queries and retention policies

### 6. Performance Optimization
- Use compression for storage efficiency (Parquet format)
- Implement caching layer with ElastiCache for repeated thread lookups
- Batch writes to databases using Kinesis Data Firehose
- Apply sharding for high-volume thread ID lookups

### 7. Scaling Considerations
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Increase container count or Lambda concurrency
- **Vertical Scaling**: Adjust container sizes for memory-intensive operations
- **Database Scaling**: Read replicas and auto-scaling for RDS
- **Cost Optimization**: Spot instances for batch processing, Reserved instances for baseline capacity

### 8. Fault Tolerance
- Implement idempotent processing to handle duplicates
- Use SQS dead-letter queues for failed messages
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Regular snapshots of processing state

### 9. Monitoring & Alerting
- Monitor processing latency and error rates
- Set alerts for abnormal error patterns
- Track throughput against expected baseline
- Dashboard for overall system health

## Implementation Roadmap
1. Build core parsing engine with containerization
2. Set up basic AWS infrastructure with Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation/Terraform)
3. Implement monitoring and logging
4. Develop and test scaling mechanisms
5. Add fault tolerance and recovery procedures
6. Performance testing and optimization
7. Production deployment with phased rollout
